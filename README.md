# National Service Scripts Dump

## Motivation

Hi there! This repository is to store scripts that I have made during my National Service to make my (and my peers'/superiors') lives easier. If you are an understudy (or grand-understudy) of mine, hello!
I hope this repository will serve you well. In each directory, you can find scripts that hopefully would be helpful to you.

Within each directory are specific setup and usage guides for each script.

## List of scripts

### Safety Quiz Checker

As requested by AST Jin Xing, I made this script to automate the marking process of monthly safety quiz attempts.

### Appraisals Results Generation

My secondary appointment in Coyote Company is the Company Appraisals IC. After collecting all the required results via Google Forms, the scripts will generate and rebase the appraisal results based on the
requirements of the company.
